## Description

A little game to present a the GitOps. This not for production use, this is only learning purpose and to arouse the interest regarding to GitOps.

The plan to easy to understand and lean more about the GitOps.  
This will show, how can anybody create a simple flow with a simple app. The goal is to create a simple Dokuwiki with automated deployment.

GitOps are not equal with these softwares only. You can use your favorite solutions for git GitHub, Gitlab, BitBucket etc. You can use ArgoCD or Rancher instead of FluxCD. So lot of different solutions are on the internet to apply GitOps methodology on your system. In this current case we will use the `GitHub+FluxCD+Kubernetes+Helm` combination to present the GitOps.

If you have not GitHub account please create an account for yourself free on [GitHub signup page](https://github.com/join). If you prefer to use a different Git based code store, then some steps will be different later (for example: FluxCD bootstrap command).

Environment:

- GitHub (code store)
- Kubernetes with Kustomization (Minikube on local machine)

Used softwares to reach the goal:

- FluxCD
- Helm
- Kubernetes (Minikube)
- Kustomize
- kubectx + kubens
- k9s

The solution will work on this way.

User push the changes to the GitHub. FluxCD will be check it via the source controller` FluxCD component. If it has a new commit try to apply it on the system. The Kustomization supported by Kubernetes default. The Kustomize controller will update the configuration on Kubernetes elements (Configmaps, Secrets, Deployments, Pods, Services etc.). The deployment with the new config will be done by Helm controller.

## Create a personal access token on GitHub

You need to create a personal access token on GitHub, because your password cannot be used with FluxCD later (and it will be not so safe)

Official guide to access token creation: [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

Feel free to define the token name. (like `fluxdemo`)  
The repo and the user only enough for this token.

## Flux preparation steps

### Create your repository on GitHub

1. Click on top right on **`"+"`** icon and choose the new repository
1. Fill the repository name: `flux-demo`
1. Check the checkbox before the text: `Add a README file`
1. Click on `Create repository` button (bottom of the page)

### Clone your repository to your device

1. Open a terminal (command line)
1. Enter the `git` directory (if you are not there already)

    ```bash
    cd ~/git
    ```

1. Clone the repository to your folder

    Replace `"<your username>"` with your username

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your username>/flux-demo.git
    ```

1. Enter the directory

    ```bash
    cd flux-demo
    ```

1. Create a new branch for test

    ```bash
    git checkout -b demo1
    ```

## Prepare FluxCD for first use

All of the command need to run in the git repo folder.  
Default: ~/.git/flux-demo

1. Create directory structure:

Use this command to create the directory structure:
Note: It will not work maybe on Windows.

```bash
mkdir -p apps/{base,prod,stg,dev} \
         clusters/{prod,stg,dev} \
         infrastructure/{base,prod,stg,dev} \
         flux-init/
```

More information about the structure: [https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/repository-structure/](https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/repository-structure/)

Sample result of tree command:

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clusters
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flux-init
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev
```

## Prepare FluxCD

### Introduction

We will work only with the **`"dev"`** environment. Feel free to practice on the other environments.

Hints for file exiting. It will be used **vi** and after every commands need to be hit the Enter key.

If you prefer different editor feel free to use it.

### Prepare configuration

All of the command need to run in the git repo folder.  
Default: ~/.git/flux-demo

We are creating the Flux deployment for Kubernetes

1. Create namespace configuration file

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/namespace.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: flux-system
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create role configuration

    This role will be guaranteed the access to the Kubernetes objects.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/role.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml

    - apiGroups: ["helm.fluxcd.io"]
      resources: ["helmreleases"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create role-binding configuration

    This will be assign the role with the service account.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/role-binding.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: flux-sa-rb
      namespace: flux-system
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Role
      name: flux-role
    subjects:
    - name: flux-sa
      namespace: flux-system
      kind: ServiceAccount
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create cluster role configuration

    This role will describe the right to the cluster.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/cluster-role.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole

    subjects:
    - name: flux-sa
      namespace: flux-system
      kind: ServiceAccount
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create kustomization configuration

    This will call the previous configuration in the defined order and apply it.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml

    - cluster-role-binding.yaml
    - namespace.yaml
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Verify your files are correct and ready to deploy them

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -k flux-init/ --dry-run=client
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```bash

    rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/flux-sa-rb configured (dry run)
    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/flux-crb configured (dry run)
    ```

1. Push your code to the GitHub

    ```bash
    git push -u origin demo1
    ```

### Deploy FluxCD

1. Deploy the FluxCD roles on Kubernetes

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -k flux-init/
    ```

1. Bootstrap the FluxCD

    Create a connection between the FluxCD and the Git repository via SSH. If you are using GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket please see the [FluxCD documentation bootstrap section](https://fluxcd.io/docs/cmd/flux_bootstrap/) about the possibilities.

    Some words about the parameters:

    - HTTPS will be used for the communication
    - Owner is your username every time
    - Repository cover your repository name (`"flux-demo"`)
    - Branch is your branch that you are already created above.
    - PATH will be define which environment is deployed here
    - Private means your repo will configured as public (and not private)
    - Personal define the owner is a user and not an organization
    - Namespace parameter is telling which namespace are prepared to flux (basically it is optional in this case, because all of the config file contains the namespace configuration)
    - Token auth parameter force the token auth method to GitHub

    ```bash
    flux bootstrap github \
      --owner=<your github username> \
      --repository=flux-demo \
      --branch=demo1 \
      --path=clusters/dev \
      --private=false \
      --personal=true \
      --namespace=flux-system \
      --token-auth
    ```

    Please copy your access token after this message:

    `Please enter your GitHub personal access token (PAT):`

    Sample command output:

    ```bash
    ‚ñ∫ connecting to github.com
    ‚ñ∫ cloning branch "demo1" from Git repository "https://github.com/<your username>/flux-demo.git"
    ‚úî cloned repository

    ```

1. We have a base FluxCD installation on Kubernetes.

    You can able to check it with k9s  
    (the k9s documentation are linked above)

    or you can check it manually

    ```bash
    kubens flux-system
    kubectl get pods
    ```

## App deployments with FluxCD

We will create files, and those will describe our software resources (like a Helm chart repositories),application Helm charts, application configuration.

### Nginx ingress controller

Nginx controller will be deployed from Helm chart. In first step need to be defined the Helm repository, after we can prepare the configuration for the nginx-controller Helm Chart and last step to define the Helm release.

Nginx ingress controller is an infrastructure related element and it will be serve our application ingresses. That is the reason, why we add it to the infrastructure directory instead of apps/base.

| Function place | Path |
|----------------|------|
| Repository definition | infrastructure/base/sources/ |  
| Flux configuration | cluster/`<env>`/ |
| Configuration | apps/`<env>`/ |
| Helm release configuration | apps/base/`<app name>`/ |
| Infrastructure Helm releases | infrastructure/base/`<app name>`/ |

#### Prepare Helm repository configuration

1. Create directory for Helm chart `sources`:

   Note: The `"sources"` directory will contains the Helm chart repository definitions. I assume we will use all of the sources in all environment. If you would like to separate it, maybe possible to create a `"sources"` directory inside of each environment specific directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir infrastructure/base/sources
    ```

1. Add Bitnami as Helm repository as source of the Helm charts.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/sources/bitnami.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
    kind: HelmRepository
    metadata:
      name: bitnami
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      interval: 30m
      url: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Kustomization for sources.

    If you will to add more sources later, just define same way as above and add the file to tle list in kustomization.yaml

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/sources/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: flux-system
    resources:
      - bitnami.yaml
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Kustomization for the `dev` environment.

    If you will to add more sources later, just define same way as above and add the file to tle list in kustomization.yaml

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/dev/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    resources:
    - ../base/sources/
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Infrastructure definition for the FluxCD `dev` environment.

    ```bash
    vi clusters/dev/infrastructure.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
    kind: Kustomization
    metadata:
      name: infrastructure
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      timeout: 1m0s
      interval: 5m0s
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository
        name: flux-system
      path: ./infrastructure/dev
      prune: true
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

#### Prepare configuration for deployment

1. Create `nginx-controller` directory in infrastructure

  ```bash
  mkdir infrastructure/base/nginx-controller
  ```

1. Create namespace for Nginx ingress controller

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/namespace.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create cluster role binding

    It gives access to Flux to deploy in this namespace.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/cluster-role-binding.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: flux-nginx-rb
      namespace: nginx
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: flux-cr
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: flux-sa
      namespace: flux-system
    - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Group
      name: system:serviceaccounts
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create Nginx Helm release

    Helm chart values reference: [https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller/values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller/values.yaml)

    It will be configured the Helm to deploy the chart.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/release.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
    kind: HelmRelease
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    spec:
      releaseName: nginx-ingress-controller
      chart:
        spec:
          chart: nginx-ingress-controller
          sourceRef:
            kind: HelmRepository
            name: bitnami
            namespace: flux-system
      interval: 0h5m0s
      install:
        remediation:
          retries: 3
      values:
        nameOverride: "nginx"
        fullnameOverride: "nginx"
        podSecurityPolicy:
          enabled: false
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Kustomization to prepare the Nginx controller deployment on Kubernetes.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: nginx
    resources:
    - namespace.yaml
    - cluster-role-binding.yaml
    - release.yaml
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add the nginx deployment to the existing Kustomization for the `dev` environment.

    If you will to add more sources later, just define same way as above and add the file to tle list in kustomization.yaml

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/dev/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the line to the list

    ```yaml
    - ../base/nginx-controller/
    ```

    The result looks this:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    resources:
    - ../base/sources/
    - ../base/nginx-controller/
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

#### Deploy the configuration

In this case just commit all files and push it into the Git repository

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Nginx ingress controller"
git push
```

#### Verify the deployment

You have a choice all of the kubernetes command can be apply in K9s as well. Be careful, the K9s not changing context or namespace in your terminal. It is just happen inside the software.

If you have a kubectx and kubens command the next few step will be easier a bit. The original kubectl commands are also added to the documentation.

1. Go to the terminal
1. Configure the right Kubernetes context

    ```bash
    kubectx minikube
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context minikube
    ```

1. Get all namespaces

    ```bash
    kubectl get ns
    ```

    Sample result:
    You have to focus to the

    - `flux-system` - here hiding the FluxCD, it was created with the bootstrap command earlier
    - `nginx` - here is our nginx ingress controller resources

    ```bash
    NAME              STATUS   AGE
    default           Active   135m
    flux-system       Active   132m
    kube-node-lease   Active   135m
    kube-public       Active   135m
    kube-system       Active   135m
    nginx             Active   120m
    ```

1. Check the ingress controller is working well

    1. Expose the LoadBalancer IP (minikube works different then the normal Kubernetes)

        Get the existing services in `nginx` namespace

        ```bash
        kubectl get svc -n nginx
        ```

        Sample output:

        You will be see the `External-IP` is on `pending` state. If you are using minikube, it is normal. You can get the right external access with `minikube` command. The port mappings ae in this list that will be shown at minikube command output.

        ```bash
        NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
        nginx                   LoadBalancer   10.100.54.208   <pending>     80:30308/TCP,443:32583/TCP   99m
        nginx-default-backend   ClusterIP      10.100.217.54   <none>        80/TCP                       99m
        ```

        Get external IP with minikube

        ```bash
        minikube service nginx -n nginx --url
        ```

        Sample result:

        ```bash
        http://192.168.1.2:30308   # this is pointing to port 80 in Kubernetes
        http://192.168.1.2:32583   # this is pointing to port 443 in Kubernetes
        ```

        Next step to test the URL-s above with curl

        ```bash
        curl http://192.168.1.2:30308
        curl http://192.168.1.2:30583
        ```

        You will be get HTTP error 404, that means our nginx ingress controller is working well, but no ingresses configured yet.

        Note: The ports at end of the URL will be changes anytime, if Nginx ingress controller will be redeployed by FluxCD .

### Deploy DokuWiki as first app

Description: Dokuwiki will be deployed by FluxCD and Nginx ingress controller will be take care of the incoming traffic to Dokuwiki.

Incoming traffic: Client -- http traffic --> Nginx ingress controller -> Dokuwiki service -> Dokuwiki pod

Dokuwiki structure, that will be apply below:

- New namespace: `wiki`
- New clusterrolebinding for the new namespace (FluxCD will get access to the new namespace)
- 1 pod, with one container for dokuwiki, based on the official Bitnami image
- 1 service for the pod
- Added deployment to the Kustomization

Notes:

- New source not need to define, because we will use the existing Bitnami Helm chart repository.
- Ingress will be defined at the Helm release
- Service will be defined at the Helm release

Workdir: apps/base/dokuwiki

1. Create `dokuwiki` directory in apps/base

  ```bash
  mkdir apps/base/dokuwiki
  ```

1. Create namespace for Nginx ingress controller

    ```bash
    vi apps/base/dokuwiki/namespace.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: wiki
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create cluster role binding

    It gives access to Flux to deploy in this namespace.

    ```bash
    vi apps/base/dokuwiki/cluster-role-binding.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: flux-dokuwiki-rb
      namespace: wiki
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: flux-cr
    subjects:
      - kind: ServiceAccount
        name: flux-sa
        namespace: flux-system
      - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: Group
        name: system:serviceaccounts
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create Dokuwiki Helm release

    Helm chart guide for Dokuwiki: [https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/dokuwiki](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/dokuwiki)

    You can define the values override in the `values` section of release definition.

    It will be configured the Helm to deploy the chart.

    ```bash
    vi apps/base/dokuwiki/release.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
    kind: HelmRelease
    metadata:
      name: dokuwiki
    spec:
      releaseName: dokuwiki
      chart:
        spec:
          chart: dokuwiki
          sourceRef:
            kind: HelmRepository
            name: bitnami
            namespace: flux-system
      interval: 0h5m0s
      install:
        remediation:
          retries: 3
      values:
        podSecurityPolicy:
          enabled: false
        metrics:
          enabled: false
        ingress:
          enabled: true
          ingressClassName: "nginx"
          path: /
          hostname: dokuwiki.local

    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Kustomization to prepare the Dokuwiki deployment on Kubernetes.

    ```bash
    vi apps/base/dokuwiki/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following content to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: wiki
    resources:
    - namespace.yaml
    - cluster-role-binding.yaml
    - release.yaml
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Define the Dokuwiki deployment to the Kustomization for the `dev` environment.

    If you will to add more sources later, just define same way as above and add the file to tle list in kustomization.yaml

    ```bash
    vi apps/dev/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Create file with this content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: wiki
    resources:
    - ../base/dokuwiki/
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Define the Dokuwiki deployment for Flux on the `dev` environment.

    The Nginx ingress controller should be deployed before the Dokuwiki, becaus it will take care of the incoming traffic. It can define via `dependsOn` option in `spec` section (see the config below).

    Open file for edit:

    ```bash
    vi clusters/dev/dokuwiki.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add this content to file:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
    kind: Kustomization
    metadata:
      name: dokuwiki
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      dependsOn:
        - name: infrastructure
      timeout: 1m0s
      interval: 5m0s
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository
        name: flux-system
      path: ./apps/dev
      prune: true
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

#### Deploy Dokuwiki configuration

In this case just commit all files and push it into the Git repository

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Dokuwiki deployment"
git push
```

Flux will be deploy the Dokuwiki automatically. You have to wait max. 1 minutes for Kustomization, and 5 minutes for the beginning of the Helm chart deployment. In worst case you have a new Dokuwiki deployment soon. You can decrease the reconcilation periods, but can be generate a huge load and pending Helm releases.

#### Verify Dokuwiki deployment

You have a choice all of the kubernetes command can be apply in K9s as well. Be careful, the K9s not changing context or namespace in your terminal. It is just happen inside the software.

If you have a kubectx and kubens command the next few step will be easier a bit. The original kubectl commands are also added to the documentation.

1. Go to the terminal
1. Configure the right Kubernetes context

    ```bash
    kubectx minikube
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context minikube
    ```

1. Get all namespaces

    ```bash
    kubectl get ns
    ```

    Sample result:
    You have to focus to the

    - `wiki` - here are our Dokuwiki resources

    ```bash
    NAME              STATUS   AGE
    default           Active   135m
    flux-system       Active   132m
    kube-node-lease   Active   135m
    kube-public       Active   135m
    kube-system       Active   135m
    nginx             Active   120m
    wiki              Active   100m
    ```

1. Check the ingress definition is there.

    1. Get the existing ingress in `wiki` namespace

        ```bash
        kubectl get ingress -n wiki
        ```

        Sample output:

        You can configure the domain in values section at the Helm release: apps/base/dokuwiki/release.yaml

        ```bash
        NAME       CLASS   HOSTS            ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
        dokuwiki   nginx   dokuwiki.local   192.168.1.2   80      41m
        ```

    1. Add temporary entry to your /etc/hosts file:

        Open file for edit:

        ```bash
        sudo vi /etc/hosts
        ```

        Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

        Add this line to the `hosts` file:  
        Note: IP will be different on your device, so please your machine IP, that are presented in address column by the previous command.

        ```bash
        192.168.1.2 dokuwiki.local
        ```

        Add this content to file:

        ```bash
        127.0.0.1 localhost
        
        # Dokuwiki domain
        192.168.1.2 dokuwiki.local
        ```

        Save file with `:wq`

    1. Get external URL with minikube

        ```bash
        minikube service nginx -n nginx --url
        ```

        Sample result:  
        Note: IP will be different on your device, so please your machine IP, that are presented in address column by the previous command.

        ```bash
        http://192.168.1.2:30308   # this is pointing to port 80 in Kubernetes
        http://192.168.1.2:32583   # this is pointing to port 443 in Kubernetes
        ```

        Next step to test the URL-s above with curl

        ```bash
        curl -I http://dokuwiki.local:30308
        curl -I http://dokuwiki.local

        You will be get HTTP response code 200, that means the Dokuwiki is available and ready to use.

        Note: The ports at end of the URL will be changes anytime, if Nginx ingress controller will be redeployed by FluxCD.
