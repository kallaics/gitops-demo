## Description

A little game to present a the GitOps.

The plan to easy to understand and lean more about the GitOps.  
This will show, how can anybody create a simple flow with a simple app. The goal is to create a simple web server with automated  deployment.

GitOps are not equal with these softwares only. You can use your favorite solutions for git GitHub, Gitlab, BitBucket etc. You can use ArgoCD instead of FluxCD. So lot of different solution are on the internet to apply GitOps methodology on your system. In this current case we will use the Kubernetes as infrastructure.

Enviroment:

- GitHub
- Kubernetes with Kustomization

Used softwares to reach the goal:

- FluxCD
- Helm
- Kustomize
- kubectx + kubens
- k9s

The solution will work on this way.

User send a git commit. FluxCD will be check it via the source controller` FluxCD component. If it has a new commit try to apply it on the system. The Kustomization supported by Kubernetes default. The Kustomize controller will update the configurtion on Kubernetes elements (Configmaps, Secrects, Deployments, Pods, Services etc.). The deployment with the new config will be done by Helm controller.

I will be use the Flux word instead of the FluxCD in my documentation. Please keep in your mind.

## Create a personal access token

You need to create a personal access token on GitHub, because your password cannot be used with FluxCD later (and it will be not so safe)

Official guide to access token creation: [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

Feel free to define the token name. (example: fluxdemo)
The repo and the user only enough for this token.

## Flux preparation steps

### Create your repository on GitHub

1. Click on top right on **`"+"`** icon and chhose the new repository
1. Fill the repository name: `flux-demo`
1. Check the checkbox before the text: `Add a README file`
1. Click on `Create repository` button (bottom of the page)

### Clone your repository to your device

1. Open a terminal (command line)
1. Enter the `git` directory (if you are not there already)

    ```bash
    cd ~/git
    ```

1. Clone the repository to your folder

    Replace `"<your username>"` with your username

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your username>/flux-demo.git
    ```

1. Enter the direytory

    ```bash
    cd flux-demo
    ```

1. Create a new branch for test

    ```bash
    git checkout -b demo1
    ```

## Prepare FluxCD for first use

All of the command need to run inthe git repo folder.  
Default: ~/.git/flux-demo

1. Create directory structure:

Use this command to create the directory structure:
Note: It will not work maybe on Windows.

```bash
mkdir -p apps/{base,prod,stg,dev} \
         clusters/{prod,stg,dev} \
         infrastructure/{base,prod,stg,dev} \
         infrastructure/base/sources \ 
         flux-init/
```

More information about the structure: [https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/repository-structure/](https://fluxcd.io/docs/guides/repository-structure/)

The `"sources"` directory will contains the Helm chart repository definitions. I assume we will use all of the sources in all environment. If you would like to separate it, maybe possible to create a `"sources"` directory inside of each environment specifc directory.

Sample result of tree command:

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clusters
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev
|   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sources
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flux-init
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prod
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dev
```

## Create Flux code

### Introduction

We will work only with the **`"dev"`** environment. Feel free to practice on the other environments.

Hints for file exiting. It will be used **vi** and after every commands need to be hit the Enter key.

If you prefer different editor feel free to use it.

### Prepare configuration

All of the command need to run inthe git repo folder.  
Default: ~/.git/flux-demo

We are creating the Flux deployment for Kubernetes

1. Create namespace configuration file

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/namespace.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: flux-system
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create role configuration

    This role will be guaranteed the access to the Kubernetes objects.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/role.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml

      verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
    - apiGroups: ["helm.fluxcd.io"]
      resources: ["helmreleases"]
      verbs: ["*"]
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create role-binding configuration

    This will be assign the role with the service account.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/role-binding.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: flux-sa-rb
      namespace: flux-system
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Role
      name: flux-role
    subjects:
    - name: flux-sa
      namespace: flux-system
      kind: ServiceAccount
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create cluster role configuration

    This role will descirbe the right to the cluster.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/cluster-role.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: flux-cr
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - apiextensions.k8s.io
      resources:
      - customresourcedefinitions
      verbs:
      - list
      - watch
    - apiGroups:
      - ""
      resources:
      - namespaces
      verbs:
      - list
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create cluster role binding configuration

    This will assign the cluster role with the service account.

    subjects:
    - name: flux-sa
      namespace: flux-system
      kind: ServiceAccount
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create kustomization configuration

    This will call the previous configuration in the defined order and apply it.

    ```bash
    vi flux-init/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    - cluster-role.yaml
    - cluster-role-binding.yaml
    - namespace.yaml
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Verify your files are correct and ready to deploy them

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -k flux-init/ --dry-run=client
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```bash
    namespace/flux-system configured (dry run)

    clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/flux-crb configured (dry run)
    ```

1. Push your code to the GitHub

    ```bash
    git push -u origin demo1
    ```

### Deploy FluxCD

1. Deploy the FluxCD roles on Kubernetes

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -k flux-init/
    ```

1. Bootstrap the FluxCD

    Create a connection between the FluxCD and the Git repository via SSH. If you are using GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket please see the [FluxCD documentation bootstrap section](https://fluxcd.io/docs/cmd/flux_bootstrap/) about the possibilities.

    Some words about the parameters:

    - HTTPS will be used for the communication
    - Owner is your username every time
    - Repository cover your repository name (`"flux-demo"`)
    - Branch is your branch that you are already created above.
    - PATH will be define which environment is deployed here
    - Private means your repo will configured as public (and not private)
    - Personal define the owner is a user and not an organization
    - Namespace parameter is telling which namespace are prepaed to flux (basically it is optional in thiss case, because all of the config file contains the namespace configuration)
    - Token auth parater force the token auth method to GitHub

    ```bash
    flux bootstrap github \
      --owner=<your github username> \
      --repository=flux-demo \
      --branch=demo1 \
      --path=clusters/dev \
      --private=false \
      --personal=true \
      --namespace=flux-system \
      --token-auth
    ```

    Please copy your access token after this message:

    `Please enter your GitHub personal access token (PAT):`

    Sample command output:

    ```bash
    ‚ñ∫ connecting to github.com
    ‚ñ∫ cloning branch "demo1" from Git repository "https://github.com/<your username>/flux-demo.git"
    ‚úî cloned repository

    ```

1. We have a base FluxCD installation on Kubernetes.

    You can able to check it with k9s  
    (the k9s documentation are linked above)

    or you can check it manually

    ```bash
    kubens flux-system
    kubenctl get pods
    ```

## App deployments with FluxCD

We will create files, and those will describe our software resources (like a Helm chart repositories),application Helm charts, application configuration.

### Nginx ingress controller

Nginx controller will be deployed from Helm chart. In first step need to be defined the Helm repository, after we can prepare the configuration for the nginx-controller Helm Chart and last step to define the Helm release.

Nginx ingress controller is an infrastructure related element and it will be serve our application ingresses. That is the reason, why we add it to the infrastructure directory instead of apps/base.

| Function place | Path |
|----------------|------|
| Repository defintion | infrastructure/base/sources/ |  
| Flux configuration   | cluster/`<env>`/ |
| Configuration | apps/`<env>`/ |
| Helm release configuration | apps/base/`<app name>`/ |
| Infrastructure Helm releases | infrastructure/base/`<app name>`/ |

#### Prepare Helm repository configuration

1. Add Bitnami as Helm repository as source of the Helm charts.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/sources/bitnami.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
    kind: HelmRepository
    metadata:
      name: bitnami
    spec:
      interval: 30m
      url: https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Kustomization for sources.

    If you will to add more sources later, just define same way as above and add the file to tle list in kustomization.yaml

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/sources/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: flux-system
    resources:
    - bitnami.yaml
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Kustomization for the `dev` environment.

    If you will to add more sources later, just define same way as above and add the file to tle list in kustomization.yaml

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/dev/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: flux-system
    resources:
    - ../base/sources/
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Infrastructure definition for the FluxCD `dev` environment.

    ```bash
    vi clusters/dev/infrastructure.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
    kind: Kustomization
    metadata:
      name: infrastructure-dev
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      timeout: 1m0s
      interval: 5m0s
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository
        name: flux-system
      path: ./infrastructure/dev
      prune: true
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

#### Prepare configuration for deplyoment

1. Create `nginx-controller` directory in infrastructure

  ```bash
  mkdir infrastructure/base/nginx-controller
  ```

1. Create namespace for Nginx ingress controller

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/namespace.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create cluster role binding

    It gives access to Flux to deploy in this namespace.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/cluster-role-binding.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: flux-nginx-rb
      namespace: nginx
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: flux-cr
    subjects:
      - kind: ServiceAccount
        name: flux-sa
        namespace: flux-system
      - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: Group
        name: system:serviceaccounts
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Create Nginx Helm release

    Helm chart values reference: [https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller/values.yaml](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/blob/master/bitnami/nginx-ingress-controller/values.yaml)

    It will be configred the Helm to deploy the chart.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/release.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
    kind: HelmRelease
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    spec:
      releaseName: nginx-ingress-controller
      chart:
        spec:
          chart: nginx-ingress-controller
          sourceRef:
            kind: HelmRepository
            name: bitnami
            namespace: flux-system
      interval: 0h5m0s
      install:
        remediation:
          retries: 3
      values:
        nameOverride: "nginx"
        fullnameOverride: "nginx"
        podSecurityPolicy:
          enabled: false
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add Kustomization to prepare the Nginx controller deployment on Kubernetes.

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/base/nginx-controller/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the following contect to the file

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: nginx
    resources:
    - namespace.yaml
    - cluster-role-binding.yaml
    - release.yaml
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

1. Add the nginx deployment to the existing Kustomization for the `dev` environment.

    If you will to add more sources later, just define same way as above and add the file to tle list in kustomization.yaml

    ```bash
    vi infrastructure/dev/kustomization.yaml
    ```

    Enable file edit with `insert` key or `i` key

    Add the line to the list

    ```yaml
    - ../base/nginx-controller/
    ```

    The result looks this:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Kustomization
    namespace: flux-system
    resources:
    - ../base/sources/
    - ../base/nginx-controller/
    ```

    Save file with `:wq`

#### Deploy the configuration

In this case just commit all files and push it into the Git repository

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Nginx ingress controller"
git push
```

#### Verify the deployment

You have a choice all of the kubernetes command can be apply in K9s as well. Be careful, the K9s not changing context or namespace in your terminal. It is just happen inside the software.

If you have a kubectx and kubens command the next few step will be easier a bit. The original kubectl commans are also added to the documentation.

1. Go to the terminal
1. Configure the right Kubernetes context

    ```bash
    kubectx minikube
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    kubectl config use-context minikube
    ```

1. Get all namepaces

    ```bash
    kubectl get ns
    ```

    Sample result:
    You have to focus to the

    - `flux-system` - here hiding the FluxCD, it was created with the bootstrap command earlier
    - `nginx` - here is our nginx ingress controller resources

    ```bash
    NAME              STATUS   AGE
    default           Active   135m
    flux-system       Active   132m
    kube-node-lease   Active   135m
    kube-public       Active   135m
    kube-system       Active   135m
    nginx             Active   120m
    ```

1. Check the ingress controller is working well

    1. Expose the LoadBalancer IP (minikube works different then the normal Kubernetes)

        Get the exisiting services in `nginx` namespace

        ```bash
        kubectl get svc -n nginx
        ```

        Sample output:

        You will be see the `External-IP` is on `pending` state. If you are using minikibe, it is normal. You can get the right external access with `minikube` command. The port mappings ae in this list that will be shown at minikube command output.

        ```bash
        NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
        nginx                   LoadBalancer   10.100.54.208   <pending>     80:30308/TCP,443:32583/TCP   99m
        nginx-default-backend   ClusterIP      10.100.217.54   <none>        80/TCP                       99m
        ```

        Get external IP with minikube

        ```bash
        minikube service nginx -n nginx --url
        ```

        Sample result:

        ```bash
        http://192.168.1.2:30308   # this is ponting to port 80 in Kubernete
        http://192.168.1.2:32583   # this is pointing to port 443 in Kubenetes
        ```

        Next step to test the URL-s above with curl

        ```bash
        curl http://192.168.1.2:30308
        curl http://192.168.1.2:30583
        ```

        You will be get HTTP error 404, that means our nginx ingress controller is working well, but no ingresses configured yet.
