# GitOps demo

My goal was to create my own demo for the beginners regarding to GitOps methodology. Currently we can get a bit more introduction into FluxCD and automated application deployment on Kubernetes.

This guide try to focus to the Flux, so in this case the installation steps of the requirements are documented well on their official pages.

The requirements are available in the documentation. I prepared the demo on Linux, but should works on the MacOS and Windows (WSL) as well. Please follow the guides regarding to your operating system in the preparation step.

Please go the next page for a detailed introduction.
